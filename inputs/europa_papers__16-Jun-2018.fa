//Additionally, all the entry inputs also support the following constraints (all of them ignoring case): "equal", "not equal", "contain", "not contain". These might be linked with the logical operators "and"/"or", which are short-circuited versions evaluated from left to right by ignoring other aspects like parentheses.
